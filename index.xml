Most of my projects are related to astronomy in some way and I typically code in Julia and Python. Below are some projects I feel like highlighting.
JuliaHCI JuliaHCI is a group of Julia packages for high-contrast imaging (HCI). ADI.jl was inspired by the vortex imaging pipeline (VIP) and contains algorithms and metrics used for removing speckles in angular differential imaging (ADI). Firefly.jl is still experimental, but will contain statistical models for exoplanets for use with ADI.</description></item></channel></rss>
