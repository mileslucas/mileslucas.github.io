# About Me


## Biographical Information

I am originally from Denver, Colorado, but spent most of my life growing up in Eastern Iowa. I completed my undergraduate degree in physics with minors in astronomy and computer science at Iowa State University in 2019. Currently I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Astronomy at University of Hawai'i Mānoa.

## Interests

I enjoy using programming to solve astronomical problems and provide tools for other astronomers. Some of my research interests include stellar astrophysics, Bayesian analysis, and machine learning.

Outside of research, I enjoy drumming, hiking, camping, playing video games, and photography. You can see a selection of some of my favorite photos in [my portfolio](https://portfolio.mileslucas.com).

I've been featured by [NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day (APOD) previously](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180713.html). The picture in question was taken at the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico. I had multiple great opportunities to go out and shoot photos during my research internship with NRAO. Special thanks to Dr. Miller Goss for helping make that photo happen!
