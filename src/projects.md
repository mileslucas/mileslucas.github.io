# Code Projects

Here are some of my notable projects organized by language. Feel free to check them out!

## Python

### [Starfish](https://github.com/iancze/Starfish)

Starfish is a tool for doing statistical inference on stellar spectra. It utilizes a Bayesian emulator along with special covariance modelling to address deficiencies in standard likelihood estimation with current synthetic spectra libraries.

### [junkin.space](https://junkin.space)

This was a small project for an Iowa State hackathon that ended up winning 1st place! It is a small Flask website that visualizes objects in space around Earth using [`plotly`](https://plot.ly).

## Julia

### [Spectra.jl](https://github.com/juliaastro/spectra.jl)

This is a project for creating data structures and transformations for stellar spectra. It is based largely off my work in [Starfish](/projects.html#starfish), but seeks to leverage as many advantages of Julia as possible. One of the big selling points is first-class integration with [`Unitful.jl`](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl).
