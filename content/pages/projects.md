Title: Projects

Here are some of my notable coding projects. Feel free to go check them out!


## Python

### [Starfish](https://github.com/iancze/Starfish)

Starfish is a tool for doing statistical inference on stellar spectra. It utilizes a Bayesian emulator along with special covariance modelling to address deficiencies in standard likelihood estimation with current synthetic spectra libraries.

### [junkin.space](https://junkin.space)

This was a small project for an Iowa State hackathon that ended up winning 1st place! It is a small Flask website that visualizes objects in space around Earth.
