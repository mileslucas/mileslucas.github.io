## About Me

I am originally from Denver, Colorado, but spent most of my life growing up in Eastern Iowa. I completed my undergraduate degree in physics with minors in astronomy and computer science at Iowa State University in 2019. Currently I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Astronomy at University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa.

## Research Interests

I enjoy using programming to solve astronomical problems and provide tools for other astronomers. Check out some of the code I've written at in my [projects](/projects/). Some of my research interests include stellar astrophysics, Bayesian analysis, and machine learning. I have recently become very interested in high-contrast imaging (HCI), which pushes the limits of our best telescopes and statistical methods to image planets around other stars.

Outside of research, I enjoy drumming, hiking, camping, playing video games, and photography. You can see a selection of some of my favorite photos in my [portfolio](https://portfolio.mileslucas.com/).
