## About Me

I was born in Denver and grew up in Eastern Iowa. I completed my undergraduate degree in physics with minors in astronomy and computer science at Iowa State University in 2019. Currently I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Astronomy at University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa. I earned my M.S. in astronomy in 2021. **I am currently finishing my Ph.D. project and am actively seeking post-doctoral opportunities.**

## Research Interests


### High-contrast Imaging

My Ph.D. research revolved around upgrading the visible-light high-contrast polarimeter [VAMPIRES](https://www.naoj.org/Projects/SCEXAO/scexaoWEB/030openuse.web/040vampires.web/indexm.html). I find the intersection of optics, systems engineering, programming, and data management interesting and fulfilling, and I specialize in polarimetric instrumentation. Using polarimetry is a highly effective tool for studying circumstellar disks, and I've developed observational techniques for simultaneous polarimetric differential imaging with multiple high-contrast instruments fed by SCExAO.

### Programming
I enjoy using programming to solve astronomical problems and provide tools for other astronomers. I specialize in image processing and data processing pipelines. I am proficient in Python and Julia, and have contributed many open-source packages in both languages. 


## Personal Interests

Outside of research, I enjoy cooking, baking, photography, astrophotography, climbing, hiking, biking, and drumming. You can see a selection of some of my favorite photos in my [portfolio](https://portfolio.mileslucas.com/). I've been featured in NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day (APOD) for [this star trails photo](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180713.html) I took during a summer research internship at the Very Large Array (VLA) in Socorro, New Mexico.
